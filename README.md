## Smokebot UI

This repo contains a really basic webpage that has some home rolled client jQuery for using the Particle Cloud and connecting to the Smokebot (check out Matt Hazley's Firmware repo, I'll link to this at the point at which it is complete). We'll have some pictures of the project at some point as well, once we have a functional smoker system for making the tasty meat treats!

### Usage

To use this you'll want to set your access token, this can be gotten from the place that we get secrets from.... or your Particle account. The access token goes into the `js/index.js` file, in the `accessToken` variable at the top. Don't commit this, although in the future I'll improve this process, likely integrating a login process.
